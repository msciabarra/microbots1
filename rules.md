# Rules of the competition

## Submission

You can submit your robot to the competition clicking on "Submit to FAAS Wars"

Your robot will then partecipate to the competition.

Submitting your robot you also make it public so others can fight against it while developing their robot. 

We may remove from the list of the public robots any robot just to keep the list small. It does not imply any judgement of the robot itself. However robots generating errors or being inactive are more likely to be removed by the public list. They still partecipate to the competition.

## Round Rules

Each round will last a maximum of 10,000 "ticks". You have to destroy your enemy within the time limit or the fight will be a draw.

If your robot generates an error, either because your code is wrong or if you generate too many requests, you lose. There is a limit of 100 requests per minute.

If you win you get 3 points, if you lose 0, if is a draw both will get one point.

## Competition grouping

Each robot will be placed in a group of 10 other partecipants and fight against all the other partecipants in the group. The assignment to the group is in strict submission time order. The size of the grouping can be changed depending on the number of the partecipants

The winner is the robot that gets the higher scores.  However, it is also required it did win at least one challenge. If all the robots in a group draws, no one will pass.
 
If there are more robots with the same higher score, there will be playoff among the best performing robots to determine the winner.

All the winner of the groups will be then grouped again and fight each other to declare the winner. And so on until there is only one group and one winner for each of the 3 competitions open.

Once a competition is over all the submissions will be cleared and you will have to submit again your robot if you want to partecipate to the next.
